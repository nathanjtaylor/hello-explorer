      <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to harbor life. With a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers, it's often called the "Blue Planet" due to its vast oceans, which cover about 71% of its surface. Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), creating the perfect conditions for life as we know it. <br><br>

        Fun fact: If you could somehow drive your car straight up into space, you'd reach the edge of Earth's atmosphere in about an hour (at highway speeds) - less time than most people spend commuting to work!</p>
