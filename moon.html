      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, orbits our planet at an average distance of 384,400 kilometers. With a diameter of 3,475 kilometers, it's about one-quarter the size of Earth. Despite its smaller size, the Moon plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt and creating ocean tides.<br><br>

        Fun fact: The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at roughly the same rate that human fingernails grow (about 3.8 centimeters per year). Don't worry though - it's not planning its great escape anytime soon! </p>
